Paper Updation:
---------------

    + study design:
        + 3 existing gamified applications, and our gamified application.

    + Metrics to validate our approach of implementation of game.
        + Time taken to implement a service.
        + Time taken to gamidfy an application.
        + 

    + Metrics to measure the advantage of gamification.
        + Number ogf bugs
