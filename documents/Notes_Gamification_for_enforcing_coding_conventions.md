## Gamification for enforcing coding conventions
    + FSE'2015 paper(paper attached) titled "Gamification for enforcing coding conventions".
    + This study is done as part of the teaching activities of a local post-graduate teaching  institution. The participants are part of separate projects following the agile Scrum methodology.
    + The duration of the study is 2months(47 days) and each sprint is for a week's time.

## principal research questions they answer :
1. Does  gamification  of  coding  convention enforcement lead to improved compliance?
2. Does  gamification  cause  undesirable social effects?

They consider four game mechanics :
1. Personal Scores
2. Transparent Rules
3. Leader Board
4. Individual and Group Incentives

## Reputation score calculation :
a reputation score is calculated that averages the compliance to coding conventions of the les the developer contributed to.  Secondly, the gamication  must  be  integrated  socially  to  act  the  developers' valence judgments so that desirable behaviors will emerge more often.

## Tool they used
http://sourceforge.net/projects/collabreview/

##Questionnaire : 
To know the answers to their research questions, the authors conducted a survey with a 5 point likert scale for each of the question. Below are the questions :

    + how present scores were in the developer's consciousness,
    + how important the  gamification  was  for  them,
    + how fair it was, how well the developer did understand its computation,
    + how much the developer did like that reputation was computed,
    + how well it was fitting into the development process,
    + how acceptable the gamification was,
    + how much influence it had on the developer's way of programming,
    + how much additional effort it caused for the developer,
    + how much the code readability improved due to the intervention, if it would have made a difference for the developer to only see a team's average score instead of individual scores, and if the developer had privacy concerns
    .
## Results :
    In summary, the gamification was perceived as rather fair,likable, fitting into the situation and acceptable, and causing only few concerns.  Serious friction did not occur in the experiment.
